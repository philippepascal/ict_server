ToDo:
1. Add relays table (uuid|relayId), and db functions for it
2. Implement last operations (related to relays)
3. Add RaspPI library to control GPIO and tie it up to relay operations
    add base functions open/close
   call these functions in operate
4. Put relay operations under feature flag
5. Add Web server, with port config, TLS (self certificate)
6. map public operations (register, operate) with web server post methods
7. Install and run on rasp pi zero
8. move to electronics (buy relays, wire up)
9. install against ICT server, configure ICT server (if needed, hopefully just piggy back on current config)
10. implement iOS/watch app as client
11.
